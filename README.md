# Social-Media-Post-API

## Introduction
 Creating a new Social Media Platform for your startup? Need to mimic Social Media post logic and have a quick and easy place to store it securely? Or just looking for a fun API to test out. That is what my Social Media Post API is for, this simple yet completely secure API allows users to create accounts, which then in turn can create posts and perform full CRUD operations on them or search for posts.


 ## Motivation
As a software engineer, we love thinking of new project ideas and applying them in the best way possible. But one thing I noticed is that, despite the similarities between many projects (technology stack included) many projects end up having to develop certain components from the ground up. Because of this my idea for this project was to create a simple API which provides a very basic infrastructure for someone looking to create a social media platform, or simply for users who would like to play around with a REST API and get to know basics of web apps/services. Alongside this I chose to develop in a tech stack that I am working with at the time with my internship which to help further my understanding and gain experience.

# Tech Stack

## Frontend
- Swagger UI
- HTML5
- CSS
- JS

## Backend
- **C#**
    - .NET 6 (includes ASP .NET Core)
- Microsoft SQL Server

## Server
- Azure (with MS SQL Server and Docker Image)
- Docker (For program Image)

# Architecture and Design
    - MVC Pattern
    - Entity Framework Core
    - Dependency Injection Pattern
    - Repository design pattern
    - REST API Structure
        - With proper HTTP Status Codes
